## Protocol / Development
**Thanos hard-fork:** [**ECIP-1099**](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1099) is accepted which will halve the size and growth rate of the DAG. ECIP-1099 will require a hard-fork, code-named, Thanos. Both Hyperledger Besu and Core-geth support ECIP-1099 and upon successful testing, the Thanos hard-fork would occur at block 11,700,000.
